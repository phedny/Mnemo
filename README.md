Mnemonics
=========

In this repository, we try to create a set of 100 PAO-triplets that can be used
as mnemonics to remember 6 digit numbers. Memorizing at least one mnemonic per
day should result in knowing the entire set in a little over three months.

For every mnemonic, three highly imaginable elements are used:
* P = Person
* A = Action
* O = Object
