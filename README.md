Mnemonics
=========

In this repository, we try to create a set of 100 PAO-triplets that can be used
as mnemonics to remember 6 digit numbers. Memorizing at least one mnemonic per
day should result in knowing the entire set in a little over three months.

For every mnemonic, three highly imaginable elements are used:
* P = Person
* A = Action
* O = Object

00 A hacker wildly running circles around a rotten egg
--

The hacker is a generalization of Zero Cool, a main character in the movie
[Hackers] [00-0]. Represented by the two circles of this number is the action of
running those circles. To make the action vivid, imagine running very fast and
making wild sounds. Again represented by the two circles is the egg, which can
be made vivid by adding smell: they're rotten and stink badly.

01 The US president making a dance of joy with a huge #1 trofee
--

The person is in this mnemonic is the president of the USA for his influence on
the world. Picking an individual president makes a vivid image, like the one fo
[Abraham Lincoln] [01-0]. The action is a dance of joy one makes when being #1.
Finally, the object in this mnemonic is an enormous trofee that is awarded to
the winner.

02 Luigi dancing the tango with a dove
--

[Luigi] [02-0] is just the second half of the Mario and Luigi duo. Being the
second makes him a good candidate for this number, but his tall body and vivid
green color in his clothing makes him very memorable. As action, dancing the
[tango] [02-1] has a reference to the South American dance with staccato
movements. As object, the [dove] [02-2] references a symbol of peace, being pure
in the white color, which allows for a bright image. Alternatively, imagining a
dove with different, but bright, colors can also create a vivid image.

06 A viking throwing a mobile phone
--

The viking refers to the mobile operator [Mobile Vikings] [06-0] and can be
a very vivid image. It's absurd to see a viking throwing a mobile phone, so
that should be easily rememberable. The object in this image is a mobile phone,
since in The Netherlands all cell phone numbers start with 06.
