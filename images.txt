=== Motivation images ===

01 [president] [dance of joy] [trophy]   
The president is of course the most important person in any democratic country; the man whose decisions always go first. Imagine George Washington - the first American president ever - performing a dance of joy after winning the elections, in his hand the golden trophy for "1st president ever".

04 [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles] [sculpuring] [ninja weapons]
All four of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are giving it their utmost best to honor the origin of their names: they are sculpturing a magnificent Renaissance style sculpture. How? by using the same tools they wield to fight crime: their ninja weapons!

11 [Mad Maynard (Vinnie Jones)] [playing soccer] [football]
Mad Maynard from the movie "Eurotrip" is playing football (soccer) with the greatest football team in the world, Manchester United. Imagine him shouting and cursing as he misses the goal.

82 [Michael Jackson] [moonwalking] [white glove]
On November 30, 1982, Michael Jackson released his famous album "Thriller". On this album was the song "Billie Jean", which featured the moonwalk. Imagine Michael doing this dancemove while wearing his distinctive white glove.

88 [Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)] [sailing a ship] [compass]
In the movie "Pirates of the caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl", Captain Jack Sparrow intended to get back on his ship, while the crew on the ship was after the treasure of 882 identical Aztek coins to lift their curse. He used his trusty compass to show him the way.
[Optional: use Mad Jack the Pirate instead of Captain Jack Sparrow, he is just a nutty and makes for great images.]
